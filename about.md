## Journalist turned Data Scientist | Journalist
I use data science as a means to achieve journalistic goals.

Currently working as an Instructional Associate for General Assembly's part-time data science course and as a Contributing Data Science Writer for Open Data Science Conference (ODSC)


## How I got here.
Before I graduated from the Metis Data Science Immersive bootcamp, I worked as a freelance journalist in San Francisco for a couple years. I write about numerous topics from politics to tech to culture in forms such as opinion, longform, and multimedia. I've been known to refer to myself as a "Swiss Army Knife" journalist due to the diversity of my work.

In the spring of 2015 I became interested in the field of data journalism. It was an emerging field and given my quantitative skills—majored in economics and took advanced stats & econometrics in college—I thought it would be great fit for me. After exploring how to learn data journalism, I came across data science, which just like data journalism was having a moment too.

From there, I decided to shift my focus to data science. Right away I could tell data science was a great fit for me and I experience the same feeling that this was right for me that I had when I signed up for a journalism 101 class back in college. Then after severals months of researching and learning more about the field, in the summer of 2015 I decided to put my journalism career on hiatus and pursue data science full time with the aim of completing a three month coding bootcamp.

My first order of business was to learning Python, the most popular programming language used in data science. This was an unique challenge for me because I had no programming experience whatsoever, unless you count knowing how to use some HTML tags. I started my learning by an one day "Intro to Python" General Assembly course and was completely lost 30 minutes in. Despite my initial feelings of helplessness, I kept pushing on. I completed Codeacademy and DataQuest's Python courses each several times.

In October 2015, I applied to [Galvanize's](http://galvanize.com) data science bootcamp but I did not get in, so I went back to drawing board and doubled my Python education efforts. Two months later, I reapplied to Galvanize and also applied to [Metis](http://thisismetis.com). I got accepted into both programs and decided to go with Metis.

The 12-week bootcamp was the most intense period of my life, but extremely rewarding. Each passing class and project furthered validated my decision to pursue this field. Metis did an excellent job of facilitating an environment conducive to learning. I learned not only the hard skills that required in data science but also the soft skills such as working in teams and becoming acquainted with your data.

Since graduation I've been working on achieving my goal of bringing data science to journalism and journalism to data science.

When I don't have one hand coding and the other writing, I obsess over Liverpool Football Club and enjoy the most of what San Francisco has to offer by biking its hills and eating its burritos.
